# Tech Compare - Kiro Configuration

## Project Overview
Tech Compare is a clean, professional web application that helps developers make informed technology decisions through balanced comparisons and trade-off analysis. Built with vanilla JavaScript, it emphasizes simplicity, performance, and user experience.

## Core Philosophy
- **No single "best" answer** - Provide balanced insights rather than prescriptive solutions
- **Clean & Professional** - Minimalist design focused on content
- **Developer-Focused** - Built by developers, for developers
- **Balanced Analysis** - Show trade-offs, pros, cons, and contextual recommendations

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: CSS Custom Properties for theming, Flexbox/Grid for layouts
- **No Dependencies**: Zero external libraries for maximum performance and simplicity
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript for basic content

### File Structure
```
tech-compare/
├── index.html          # Main HTML structure with semantic markup
├── styles.css          # Professional styling with CSS custom properties
├── data.js             # Comparison data and processing logic
├── app.js              # Interactive application functionality
├── README.md           # Comprehensive documentation
└── .kiro               # This configuration file
```

### Key Design Patterns
1. **Module Pattern**: Each JS file has a clear, single responsibility
2. **Data-Driven**: All comparisons stored in structured JSON-like objects
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JS
4. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design starting from mobile breakpoints
5. **Performance-Optimized**: Intersection Observer for animations, minimal DOM manipulation

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML5 elements and ARIA labels
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Use CSS variables for consistent theming
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ features, async/await, destructuring
- **Consistent Naming**: kebab-case for CSS, camelCase for JavaScript
- **Comments**: Document complex logic and design decisions

### Adding New Comparisons
1. **Research thoroughly** - Ensure balanced, accurate information
2. **Follow data structure** - Use existing comparison objects as templates
3. **Include all sections** - pros, cons, whenToChoose, matchesCriteria, tradeoffs
4. **Test recommendations** - Verify the matching algorithm works correctly
5. **Update categories** - Add new category sections if needed

### Performance Considerations
- **Vanilla JS**: No framework overhead, faster loading
- **CSS-only animations**: Use transforms and opacity for smooth performance
- **Lazy loading**: Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
- **Minimal DOM queries**: Cache DOM elements, avoid repeated queries
- **Optimized images**: Use appropriate formats and sizes

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Balanced tone**: Avoid bias toward any technology
- **Developer-focused**: Use technical language appropriately
- **Practical insights**: Focus on real-world implications
- **Concise clarity**: Clear, direct communication without fluff
- **Evidence-based**: Back claims with concrete examples

### Comparison Quality Standards
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Include major pros, cons, and use cases
- **Current information**: Keep data up-to-date with latest versions
- **Practical scenarios**: Focus on real development situations
- **Balanced perspective**: Show both sides fairly
- **Actionable insights**: Help users make actual decisions

## Feature Roadmap

### Completed Features ✅
- Side-by-side technology comparisons
- Smart recommendation system based on requirements
- Export functionality (Markdown reports)
- Share functionality with direct links
- Responsive design for all devices
- Smooth animations and transitions
- 9 comprehensive comparisons across 4 categories

### Potential Enhancements 🚀
- **More Comparisons**: Additional technology categories (testing frameworks, deployment tools, etc.)
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter comparisons by category, difficulty, or requirements
- **Comparison History**: Save and revisit previous comparisons
- **Community Contributions**: Allow user-submitted comparisons
- **Interactive Scoring**: Let users weight criteria importance
- **Detailed Metrics**: Add performance benchmarks and statistics
- **Integration Guides**: Step-by-step setup instructions for chosen technologies

## Maintenance Notes

### Regular Updates Needed
- **Technology versions**: Keep framework/library versions current
- **Market trends**: Update job market and adoption statistics
- **New technologies**: Add emerging tools and frameworks
- **Community feedback**: Incorporate user suggestions and corrections

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] All comparisons load correctly
- [ ] Recommendation system works with various requirement combinations
- [ ] Export functionality generates proper markdown
- [ ] Share links work correctly
- [ ] Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- [ ] Animations perform smoothly
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console

## Deployment

### Static Hosting
The tool is designed for static hosting and works with:
- **GitHub Pages**: Simple deployment from repository
- **Netlify**: Automatic deployments with form handling
- **Vercel**: Optimized for frontend applications
- **Any web server**: Just serve the static files

### Performance Optimization
- **Minification**: Consider minifying CSS/JS for production
- **Compression**: Enable gzip/brotli compression on server
- **Caching**: Set appropriate cache headers for static assets
- **CDN**: Use CDN for global performance if needed
